/* Melody
 * (cleft) 2005 D. Cuartielles for K3
 *
 * This example uses a piezo speaker to play melodies.  It sends
 * a square wave of the appropriate frequency to the piezo, generating
 * the corresponding tone.
 *
 * The calculation of the tones is made following the mathematical
 * operation:
 *
 *       timeHigh = period / 2 = 1 / (2 * toneFrequency)
 *
 * where the different tones are described as in the table:
 *
 * note 	frequency 	period 	timeHigh
 * c 	        261 Hz 	        3830 	1915 	
 * d 	        294 Hz 	        3400 	1700 	
 * e 	        329 Hz 	        3038 	1519 	
 * f 	        349 Hz 	        2864 	1432 	
 * g 	        392 Hz 	        2550 	1275 	
 * a 	        440 Hz 	        2272 	1136 	
 * b 	        493 Hz 	        2028	1014	
 * C	        523 Hz	        1912 	956
